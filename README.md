Fine-tuning Transformers from HuggingFace for financials news sentiment


## Goal : Develop a specialized sentiment analyzer for financial news articles

Financial sentiment analysis differs from general sentiment analysis not only in domain, but also the purpose. The purpose behind financial sentiment analysis is usually guessing how the markets will react with the information presented in the text [9]. Loughran and McDonald (2016) presents a thorough survey of recent works on financial text analysis utilizing machine learning with "bag-of- words" approach or lexicon-based methods [12]. For example, in Loughran and McDonald (2011), they create a dictionary of financial terms with assigned values such as "positive" or "uncertain" and measure the tone of a documents by counting words. Using carefully crafted financial sentiment lexicons such as Loughran and McDonald (2011) [11] may seem a solution because they incorporate existing financial knowledge into textual analysis. However, they are based on "word counting" methods, which come short in analyzing deeper semantic meaning of a given text.

NLP transfer learning methods look like a promising solution to both of the challenges mentioned above, and are the focus of this thesis. The core idea behind these models is that by train- ing language models on very large corpora and then initializing down-stream models with the weights learned from the language modeling task, a much better performance can be achieved. The initialized layers can range from the single word embedding layer [23] to the whole model [

## Data

Here is some information on the dataset used to fine-tune BERT model for financial news sentiment

- Financial Phrasebank consists of 4845 english sentences selected randomly from financial news found on LexisNexis database. These sentences then were annotated by 16 people with background in finance and business. The annotators were asked to give labels according to how they think the information in the sentence might affect the mentioned company stock price. The dataset also includes information regarding the agreement levels on sentences among annotators.

## Results

Here I compare the sentiment scores from the fine-tuned BERT model to the out of the box TextBlob sentiment analyzer

With the predict function, given a piece of text, we split it into a list of sentences and then predict sentiment for each sentence. The output is written into a dataframe. Predictions are represented in three different columns:

1) logit: probabilities for each class
2) prediction: predicted label
3) sentiment_score: sentiment score calculated as: probability of positive - probability of negative

Below we analyze a paragraph taken out of [this article from The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/01/03/a-profit-warning-from-apple-jolts-markets). For comparison purposes, we also put the sentiments predicted with TextBlob.

`Later that day Apple said it was revising down its earnings expectations in the fourth quarter of 2018, largely because of lower sales and signs of economic weakness in China. The news rapidly infected financial markets. Appleâ€™s share price fell by around 7% in after-hours trading and the decline was extended to more than 10% when the market opened. The dollar fell by 3.7% against the yen in a matter of minutes after the announcement, before rapidly recovering some ground. Asian stockmarkets closed down on January 3rd and European ones opened lower. Yields on government bonds fell as investors fled to the traditional haven in a market storm.`
