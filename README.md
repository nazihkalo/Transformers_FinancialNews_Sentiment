# Transformers_FinancialNews_Sentiment
Fine-tuning Transformers from HuggingFace for financials news sentiment


## Goal 


## Data

Here is some information on the dataset used to fine-tune BERT model for financial news sentiment

- Financial Phrasebank consists of 4845 english sentences se- lected randomly from financial news found on LexisNexis database. These sentences then were annotated by 16 people with background in finance and business. The annotators were asked to give labels according to how they think the information in the sentence might affect the mentioned company stock price. The dataset also includes information regarding the agreement levels on sentences among annotators.
- The dataset can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251231364_FinancialPhraseBank-v10
